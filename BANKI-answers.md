## Technical Questions

Most of the technical questions should have a three sentence response in the EUE format:

- **Explanation**
- **Use**
- **Example**

### HTML

- [x] What does a doctype do?
  - **Explanation:**
  > DOCTYPE is an abbreviation for Document Type. A DOCTYPE is always associated to a DTD - for Document Type Definition.
  - **Use:**
  > For webpages, the DOCTYPE declaration is required. It is used to tell user agents what version of the HTML specifications your document respects.
  - **Example:**
  > The DOCTYPE declaration for the HTML5 standards is `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
  - **Source:** [FE Interview Handbook](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/html-questions/#what-does-a-doctype-do)

- [x] How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?
  - **Explanation:**
  > By setting the lang attributes on the various elements within the page.
  - **Use:**
  > The lang attribute can be used on various elements (typically html, p, li...)
  - **Example:**
  > You can set the whole site as being english by setting the html element `<html lang="en">` Or you could set a paragraph as spanish with `<p lang="es">`
  - **Source:** [MDN]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang)

- [x] What kinds of things must you be wary of when designing or developing for multilingual sites?
  - **Explanation:**
  > There are quite a few different nuances to pay attention to including:
  >
  > - Including the lang attribute
  > - Allowing users to change the language
  > - Minimize text in raster based images
  > - Text overflow when translated
  > - How colors are perceived
  > - Date and currency formats
  > - Language reading direction
  > - Don't concatenate translated strings
  >
  - **Source:** [FE Interview Handbook](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/html-questions/#what-kind-of-things-must-you-be-wary-of-when-designing-or-developing-for-multilingual-sites)

- [x] What are `data-` attributes good for?
  - **Explanation:**
  > They allow the storage data to the page or elements within the page
  - **Use:**
  > Generally not encouraged. Users are able to modify the data attribute easily with inspect tool.
  >
  > However, one perfectly valid use of data attributes, is to add a hook for end to end testing frameworks without having to create a meaningless classes or ID attributes.
  - **Example:**
  > `data-selector='the-thing'`
  - **Source:** [FE Interview Handbook](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/html-questions/#what-are-data--attributes-good-for)

- [x] Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the building blocks of HTML5?
  - **Explanation:**
  >
  > - Semantics - Allowing you to describe more precisely what your content is.
  > - Connectivity - Allowing you to communicate with the server in new and innovative ways.
  > - Offline and storage - Allowing webpages to store data on the client-side locally and operate offline more efficiently.
  > - Multimedia - Making video and audio first-class citizens in the Open Web.
  > - 2D/3D graphics and effects - Allowing a much more diverse range of presentation options.
  > - Performance and integration - Providing greater speed optimization and better usage of computer hardware.
  > - Device access - Allowing for the usage of various input and output devices.
  > - Styling - Letting authors write more sophisticated themes.
  >

- [x] Describe the difference between a cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage.
  - **Explanation:**
  > Cookies can be initiated by the server, have a manually set expiration date are small file size and are sent to the server with HTTP request. Local and session are both initiated by the client, are a relatively large file and aren't sent to the server. The main difference between local and session is that local storage will persist forever until cleared manually and can be accessed by any window in the browser. Session storage can only be accessed by the same tab.
  - **Use:**
  > All the above-mentioned technologies are key-value storage mechanisms on the client side and can only store values as strings.
  - **Source:** [FE Interview Handbook](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/html-questions#describe-the-difference-between-a-cookie-sessionstorage-and-localstorage)

- [x] Describe the difference between `<script>, <script async> and <script defer>`.
  - **Explanation:**
  >
  > - `<script>` - HTML parsing is blocked, the script is fetched and executed immediately, HTML parsing resumes after the script is executed.
  > - `<script async>` - The script will be fetched in parallel to HTML parsing and executed as soon as it is available (potentially before HTML parsing completes). Use async when the script is independent of any other scripts on the page, for example, analytics.
  > - `<script defer>` - The script will be fetched in parallel to HTML parsing and executed when the page has finished parsing. If there are multiple of them, each deferred script is executed in the order they were encountered in the document. If a script relies on a fully-parsed DOM, the defer attribute will be useful in ensuring that the HTML is fully parsed before executing. A deferred script must not contain document.write.
  >
  - **Use:**
  >
  > - Use `async` when the script is independent of any other scripts on the page
  >
  > - `defer` is useful when you need to make sure the HTML is fully parsed before executing.

  - **Example:**
  >
  > - `async` could be used for analytics scripts.
  >
  > - A deferred script must not contain document.write

- [x] Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS `<link>`s within `<head>` and JS `<script>`s just before `</body>`? Do you know any exceptions?
  - **Explanation:**
  > Putting `<link>`s in the `<head>` allows for quick "first meaningful paint". When a page first loads, HTML and CSS are being parsed simultaneously. If you put it at the bottom of the documnet cnan lead to bugs/issues, including users just seeing a blank page or flashes of unstyled content.
  >
  >`<script>` tags block HTML parsing while they are being downloaded and executed which can slow down your page. Placing the scripts at the bottom will allow the HTML to be parsed and displayed to the user first

  - **Exception:**
  > These days its not considered to be good practice, but if your script contains `document.write()` you would put it in the `<head>`.
  >
  >Also if you need to put `<script>`s in the `<head>`, use the `defer` attribute, which will achieve the same effect of running the script only after the HTML is parsed but the browser can download the script earlier.

- [x] What is progressive rendering?
  - **Explanation:**
  > Progressive rendering is the name given to techniques used to improve the performance of a webpage (in particular, improve perceived load time) to render content for display as quickly as possible.
  - **Use:**
  > To improve the perceived load time of a page/content.
  - **Example:**
  >| Type | Description |
  >| ---| --- |
  >| Lazy Loading Images | Images on the page are not loaded all at once. JavaScript will be used to load an image when the user scrolls into the part of the page that displays the image.|
  > | Prioritizing visible content (aka above the fold) | Include only the minimum CSS/content/scripts necessary for the amount of page that would be rendered in the users browser first to display as quickly as possible, you can then use deferred scripts or listen for the DOMContentLoaded/load event to load in other resources and content.|
  > | Async HTML Fragments | Flushing parts of the HTML to the browser as the page is constructed on the back end |
  >
  - **Source:** [FE Interview handbook](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/html-questions#what-is-progressive-rendering)

- [x] Why you would use a `srcset` attribute in an image tag? Explain the process the browser uses when evaluating the content of this attribute.
  - **Explanation:**
  > When you want to serve different images to users depending on their device display width
  - **Use:**
  > Serving higher quality images to devices with retina display enhances the user experience while serving lower resolution images to low-end devices increase performance and decrease data wastage
  - **Example:**
  > `<img srcset="small.jpg 500w, medium.jpg 1000w, large.jpg 2000w" src="..." alt="">` tells the browser to display the small, medium or large .jpg graphic depending on the client's resolution.

- [x] Have you used different HTML templating languages before?
  - Yes, I have used Markdown, and have experience with Handlebars with Python and Mustache with React. They seem to provide similar functionality of escaping content and helpful filters for manipulating the data to be displayed.

### CSS

- [x] What is CSS selector specificity and how does it work?
  - **Explanation:**
    > The means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied.
  - **Use:**
    > Specificity is a weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration, determined by the number of each selector type in the matching selector.
  - **Example:**
    >
    > - !important has a value of 1000
    > - #id has a value of 100
    > - .class has a value of 10
    > - tag has a value of 1
    >  
    > So a selector of #id .class tag would have 111 points

  - **Source:** [MDN - CSS Specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity)

- [x] What's the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?
  - **Explanation:**
    > "normalizing" preserves useful deafults to be consistent across browsers, while "resetting" aims to remove all default styling.
  - **Use:**
    > Applying one or the other is a prefence to the developer, however going full on reset leads to more bugs and time needed to restyle everything.
  - **Example:**

    *Normalize*

    ```css
    /**
    * Correct the font size and margin on `h1` elements within `section` and 
    * `article` contexts in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
    **/

    h1 {
      font-size: 2em;
      margin: 0.67em 0;
    }
    ```

    *Resetting*

    ```css
    html, body, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;
    }
    ```

- [x] Describe floats and how they work.
  - **Explanation:**
    > The float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its   container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. The element is removed from the normal flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the flow (in contrast to absolute positioning). The CSS clear property can be used to be positioned below left/right/both floated elements.
    >
    > **NOTE:** A parent element will collapse to zero height if it contains only floated elements, to fix this it was common to use a .clearfix hack.
  - **Use:**
    > It was a precursor to flex and grid to allow elements on a screen to be able to be layed out next to each other.
  - **Example:**
    > If you wanted three boxes to be next to each other, you would set all three in a parent container with a class of .clearfix, and set all 3 boxes to float left (or right) and have a width of 33.3333%
  - **Source:** [MDN - Floats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float) | [FE Interview Handbook](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/css-questions#describe-floats-and-how-they-work)

- [x] Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed.
  - **Explanation:**
    > The z-index property in CSS controls the vertical stacking order of elements that overlap. z-index only affects elements that have a position value which is not static.
  - **Use:**
    > Allows you to put elements on top of others
  - **Example:**
    > Say if you have a navigation that is fixed at the top or bottom of the screen, you can set the container with a z-index of 1 to have it placed on top of all the other elements.
  - **Source:** [FE Interview Handbook](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/css-questions#describe-floats-and-how-they-work)

- [x] Describe BFC (Block Formatting Context) and how it works.
  - **Explanation:**
  > A block formatting context (BFC) is a part of a visual CSS rendering of a web page. It's the region in which the layout of block boxes occurs and in which floats interact with other elements.
  - **Use:**
  > A BFC is an HTML box that satisfies at least one of the following conditions:
  >
  > - The value of float is not none.
  > - The value of position is neither static nor relative.
  > - The value of display is table-cell, table-caption, inline-block, flex, or inline-flex, grid, or inline-grid.
  > - The value of overflow is not visible.
  >
  > In a BFC, each box's left outer edge touches the left edge of the containing block (for right-to-left formatting, right edges touch).
  - **Example:**
  > A absolute positioned element on a page.
  - **Source:** [MDN - Floats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Block_formatting_context) | [FE Interview Handbook](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/css-questions#describe-block-formatting-context-bfc-and-how-it-works)

- [x] What are the various clearing techniques and which is appropriate for what context?
  - **Explanation:**
  >
  > - Clear method: clear property which sets whether an element must be moved below floating elements.
  > - Clearfix method: refers to the .clearfix class
  > - Overflow method: Using `overflow: hidden` or `overflow: auto` on a perent to establish a new block formatting context and epand to contain its floated children.
  >
  - **Use:**
  >
  > - Clear: used in float layouts. Use this if you want to have adjacent floated elements to stack instead
  > - Clearfix: used in float layouts on a parent element that contains floated children. Will expand the parent to contain the children, otherwise will collapse, just as if it's floated childen had been positioned absolutely.
  >
  >   .clearfix utility class is probably the best method to use in general as it doesn't take long to construct and doesn't suffer from clipping issues like the overflow methods.
  > - Overflow: overflow hidden can cause children to be hidden if taller than parent
  >

- [x] Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site.
  - **Explanation:**
  > CSS sprites are multiple images combined together into a single larger image. Commonly use for icons.
  - **Use:**
  > You can use a sprite generator to create it. Once made, each image would  have a corresponding CSS class with `background-image`, `background-position`, and `background-size` properties definded.
  >
  > This is usefule because it reduces the number of HTTP requests a browser may need to do which would increase load speed.
  - **Example:**
  > An example would be combining press logo's for Wired, NY Times and The Washington Post into a single image file. Then on the site, with CSS, placing the file three times and moving/cropping it to display the applicable logo.
  - **Source:** [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/css-sprites/)

- [x] How would you approach fixing browser-specific styling issues?
  - **Explanation:**
  > There are a couple of ways to solve the issue such as browser specific stylesheets, using a library like bootstrap, or using css Normalize/Reset.  I'd rather use a combination as going full nuke with a reset isn't necessary and makes it a little harder to debug and using libraries can b.
  - **Use:**
  > I prefer to use the normalize/reset style sheet method. Using libraries can be "heavy" depending on the project and takes time to learn all the different classes, and trying to pinpoint a specific issue to a browser can be time consuming.

- [x] How do you serve your pages for feature-constrained browsers? What techniques/processes do you use?
  - **Explanation:**
  >
  > - Graceful degradation â The practice of building an application for modern browsers while ensuring it remains functional in older browsers.
  > - Progressive enhancement â The practice of building an application for a base level of user experience, but adding functional enhancements when a browser supports it.
  >
  - **Use:**
  >
  > - Use caniuse.com to check for feature support.
  > - Autoprefixer for automatic vendor prefix insertion.
  > - Feature detection using Modernizr.
  > - Use CSS Feature queries @support
  >
  - **Example:**
  > Instead of filling the site with `<div>` using more semantically appropriate tags like `<section> <aside> <article> <header> <footer>`
  - **Source:** [Developers life](https://blog.bullgare.com/2018/02/front-end-interview-questions-with-answers/#How_do_you_serve_your_pages_for_feature-constrained_browsers_What_techniquesprocesses_do_you_use)

- [x] What are the different ways to visually hide content (and make it available only for screen readers)?
  - **Explanation:**
  >
  > - Make the element have a size of zero width: 0; height: 0
  > - Absolute position off screen position: absolute; left: -99999px
  > - Text indent off screen if within block element text-indent: -9999px
  > - aria-label which will read the string given to the attribute.
  >
  - **Use:**
  > Generally, using the Absolute positioning is the best method since it has the least caveats, works for most elements and it's an easy technique.
  - **Source:** [FE Interview Handbook](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/css-questions)

- [x] Have you ever used a grid system, and if so, what do you prefer?
  - **Explanation:**
  > Yes, in the past I've used Bootstrap (which is based on the 12 column system), but now I typically use the 12 column grid system using flex or grid. However, depending on the scale of the project, I may use a 6 column.
  - **Use:**
  > Using the grid system is my ideal way to mockup any design with visual consistency. When if comes to coding the site I find it helps speed up the layout immensely as well.

## Whiteboard

When talking through a whiteboard problem or a coding challenge with an interviewer you should use the PREP method. (Don't write PREP in the actual interview, but use it now while doing codewars/leetcode). Going through this will help you engage with the interviewer (and possibly burn up some time ð)

- **Parameters**
  - Inputs
  - Ask questions
    - Will it always be a number?
    - Will it ever be negative?
    - Any gotchas?
- **Returns**
  - Ask questions
    - Do you want it returned or is a console.log better?
    - Should I pass a whole array of solutions back or just a single solution?
- **Examples**
  - Show a couple black box examples, aka test cases
    - I pass in these arguments and get these results, is that correct?
  - Examples are a good idea because "you have the receipts" if the interviewer decides to change things.
- **Pseudocode**
  - Write pseudocode of each of the steps

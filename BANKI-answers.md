### CSS

- [x] What is CSS selector specificity and how does it work?
  - **Explanation:**
    > The means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied.
  - **Use:**
    > Specificity is a weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration, determined by the number of each selector type in the matching selector.
  - **Example:**
    >
    > - !important has a value of 1000
    > - #id has a value of 100
    > - .class has a value of 10
    > - tag has a value of 1
    >  
    > So a selector of #id .class tag would have 111 points

  - **Source:** [MDN - CSS Specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity)

- [x] What's the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?
  - **Explanation:**
    > "normalizing" preserves useful deafults to be consistent across browsers, while "resetting" aims to remove all default styling.
  - **Use:**
    > Applying one or the other is a prefence to the developer, however going full on reset leads to more bugs and time needed to restyle everything.
  - **Example:**

    *Normalize*

    ```css
    /**
    * Correct the font size and margin on `h1` elements within `section` and 
    * `article` contexts in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
    **/

    h1 {
      font-size: 2em;
      margin: 0.67em 0;
    }
    ```

    *Resetting*

    ```css
    html, body, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;
    }
    ```

- [x] Describe floats and how they work.
  - **Explanation:**
    > The float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its   container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. The element is removed from the normal flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the flow (in contrast to absolute positioning). The CSS clear property can be used to be positioned below left/right/both floated elements.
    >
    > **NOTE:** A parent element will collapse to zero height if it contains only floated elements, to fix this it was common to use a .clearfix hack.
  - **Use:**
    > It was a precursor to flex and grid to allow elements on a screen to be able to be layed out next to each other.
  - **Example:**
    > If you wanted three boxes to be next to each other, you would set all three in a parent container with a class of .clearfix, and set all 3 boxes to float left (or right) and have a width of 33.3333%
  - **Source:** [MDN - Floats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float) | [FE Interview Handbook](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/css-questions#describe-floats-and-how-they-work)

- [x] Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed.
  - **Explanation:**
    > The z-index property in CSS controls the vertical stacking order of elements that overlap. z-index only affects elements that have a position value which is not static.
  - **Use:**
    > Allows you to put elements on top of others
  - **Example:**
    > Say if you have a navigation that is fixed at the top or bottom of the screen, you can set the container with a z-index of 1 to have it placed on top of all the other elements.

- [x] Describe BFC (Block Formatting Context) and how it works.
  - **Explanation:**
  > A block formatting context (BFC) is a part of a visual CSS rendering of a web page. It's the region in which the layout of block boxes occurs and in which floats interact with other elements.
  - **Use:**
  > A BFC is an HTML box that satisfies at least one of the following conditions:
  >
  > - The value of float is not none.
  > - The value of position is neither static nor relative.
  > - The value of display is table-cell, table-caption, inline-block, flex, or inline-flex, grid, or inline-grid.
  > - The value of overflow is not visible.
  >
  > In a BFC, each box's left outer edge touches the left edge of the containing block (for right-to-left formatting, right edges touch).
  - **Example:**
  > A absolute positioned element on a page. 
  - **Source:** [MDN - Floats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Block_formatting_context) | [FE Interview Handbook](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/css-questions#describe-block-formatting-context-bfc-and-how-it-works)

- [x] What are the various clearing techniques and which is appropriate for what context?
  - **Explanation:**
  >
  > - Clear method: clear property which sets whether an element must be moved below floating elements.
  > - Clearfix method: refers to the .clearfix class
  > - Overflow method: Using `overflow: hidden` or `overflow: auto` on a perent to establish a new block formatting context and epand to contain its floated children.
  >
  - **Use:**
  >
  > - Clear: used in float layouts. Use this if you want to have adjacent floated elements to stack instead
  > - Clearfix: used in float layouts on a parent element that contains floated children. Will expand the parent to contain the children, otherwise will collapse, just as if it's floated childen had been positioned absolutely. 
  >
  >   .clearfix utility class is probably the best method to use in general as it doesn't take long to construct and doesn't suffer from clipping issues like the overflow methods.
  > - Overflow: overflow hidden can cause children to be hidden if taller than parent

- [x] Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site.
  - **Explanation:**
  > CSS sprites are multiple images combined together into a single larger image. Commonly use for icons.
  - **Use:**
  > You can use a sprite generator to create it. Once made, each image would  have a corresponding CSS class with `background-image`, `background-position`, and `background-size` properties definded.
  >
  > This is usefule because it reduces the number of HTTP requests a browser may need to do which would increase load speed.
  - **Example:** 
  > An example would be combining press logo's for Wired, NY Times and The Washington Post into a single image file. Then on the site, with CSS, placing the file three times and moving/cropping it to display the applicable logo.

- [x] How would you approach fixing browser-specific styling issues?
  - **Explanation:**
  > There are a couple of ways to solve the issue such as browser specific stylesheets, using a library like bootstrap, or using css Normalize/Reset.  I'd rather use a combination as going full nuke with a reset isn't necessary and makes it a little harder to debug and using libraries can b.
  - **Use:**
  > I prefer to use the normalize/reset style sheet method. Using libraries can be "heavy" depending on the project and takes time to learn all the different classes, and trying to pinpoint a specific issue to a browser can be time consuming.

Here is a helpful list of other reverse interview questions: [https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview](https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview)

## Whiteboard

When talking through a whiteboard problem or a coding challenge with an interviewer you should use the PREP method. (Don't write PREP in the actual interview, but use it now while doing codewars/leetcode). Going through this will help you engage with the interviewer (and possibly burn up some time ð)

- **Parameters**
  - Inputs
  - Ask questions
    - Will it always be a number?
    - Will it ever be negative?
    - Any gotchas?
- **Returns**
  - Ask questions
    - Do you want it returned or is a console.log better?
    - Should I pass a whole array of solutions back or just a single solution?
- **Examples**
  - Show a couple black box examples, aka test cases
    - I pass in these arguments and get these results, is that correct?
  - Examples are a good idea because "you have the receipts" if the interviewer decides to change things.
- **Pseudocode**
  - Write pseudocode of each of the steps
